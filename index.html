        <p class="tect">
          Ashel Caleb olusegun, a 17-year-old (9-10-2006) frontend developer based in Lagos, Nigeria, with over 2 years of experience.  I have honed my skills in various web technologies, delivering outstanding digital solutions for small business websites and large-scale web applications.
My journey into web development began in 2023 when I discovered a free coding workshop at my local library. Fascinated by how websites were built, I got enrolled in a coding institute CodeLab where I met like minds. I created my first site using HTML and CSS. This initial project ignited my passion for web development, leading me to explore various online resources such as Codecademy and freeCodeCamp and books like "HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites" to build a strong foundation.
Dedicated time to mastering core web technologies, learning the intricacies of HTML5, CSS3, and responsive design techniques. I delved into JavaScript (TypeScript), to make my websites interactive and started using Git fo version control and GitHub to collaborate with developers.
As my skills improved, I ventured into more advanced topics and frameworks. Learning React allowed me to build dynamic and scalable web applications, while CSS frameworks Tailwind CSS helped me speed up my development process. Each step of this journey has been driven by a passion for creating innovative and user-friendly web experiences.
